  advanced_description: Middleman has the ability to generate pages which do not have a one-to-one relationship with their template files. What this means is that you can have a single template which generates multiple files based on variables. To create a proxy, you use the proxy method in your config.rb, and give the path you want to create, and then the path to the template you want to use (without any templating file extensions). Here's an example config.rb setup.
